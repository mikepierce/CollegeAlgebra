        Janet has $300,000 she'd like to invest. 
        She's researched two different investments:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A money-market fund offered by her credit union
                guaranteeing a 6.5% annual return.
            </li>
            <li>
                A high risk mutual fund that is <em>projected</em>
                to net 7.7% annual return.
            </li>
        </ul>
        She wants to balance her investment between these two funds
        to get an expected return of 6.5%. 
        How should should split up her principal into these two funds?
    </li>
    <li>
        (Pearson) 
        Drug C and Drug R are two different drugs being prescribed
        to treat the same rare medical condition.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Drug C had a 2.5% market share at the beginning of last year,
                but after an eleven week marketing campaign 
                it shot up to 9.9% market share.
                Use this information to write a linear function
                that models the market share of Drug C as a function 
                of the number of weeks after the beginning of last year.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drug R had a 8.1% market share at the beginning of last year,
                but after Drug C's marketing push, it dropped to 6.1% market share.
                Use this information to write a linear function
                that models the market share of Drug R as a function 
                of the number of weeks after the beginning of last year.
            </li>
            <li>
                What week was it during the beginning of last year
                that the market share of Drug C overtook Drug R?

        A stock broker has been given $300,000 to invest
        on behalf of an anonymous client
        who is hoping for a return of $8,000 
        on his money after a year.
        Researching the current market, she begins to consider 
        these two companies
        <ul>
            <li>
                Walt Disney Company 
                (<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dis">DIS</a>),
                a large, reliable “blue chip” corporation
                with slow by steady growth
                which has seen long-term gains on average 
                of about 1.8% annually over the last ten years
                (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/blue-chip-stocks/">according to Forbes</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
                The Bancorp Inc
                (<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TBBK">TBBK</a>), 
                the bank backing fintech companies Venmo and Chime,
                has had a wild year, its stock shooting up 13.78%!
            </li>
            <li>
                Catalyst Pharmaceutical Inc 
                (<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cprx">CPRX</a>), 
                a fairly new biotech company founded in 2002 
                specializing in drugs for rare diseases.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Disney is certainly a safer bet, 
        but she notices that she can’t just invest all the money 
        in DIS because 1.8% of $300,000 is only $5,400,
        so she has to split the investment between Disney
        and the riskier investment Bancorp.
        How should she split the $300,000 investment
        to get an expected return of $8,000?
