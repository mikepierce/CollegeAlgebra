        Suppose you invest $700 in a high-yield savings account 
        that earns 3% annual interest. 
        How much will this investment be worth a year later 
        if the interest is compounded annually?
        What if the interest is compounded monthly?
        Twice a month?  Daily?  Continuously?
    </li>
    <li>
        Suppose you need $1000 four years in the future.
        You find a high-yield savings account that offers 3% interest
        and compounds your interest monthly.
        How much do you need to invest now 
        so that your investment will be worth $1000 in four years?

        Suppose you need $1000 four years in the future,
        but only have $700 to invest now. 
        What annual interest rate would you need 
        to get this return on your investment?
        Assume the account compounds your interest monthly.
