        Suppose you invest $700 in a high-yield savings account 
        that earns 3% annual interest. 
        How much will this investment be worth a year later 
        if the interest is compounded annually?
        What if the interest is compounded monthly?
        Twice a month? Daily? Continually?

    <li class="skip-two-half">
        Suppose you need $1000 four years in the future.
        You find a high-yield savings account that offers 3% interest
        and compounds your interest monthly.
        How much do you need to invest now 
        so that your investment will be worth $1000 in four years?

        Suppose you need $1000 four years in the future,
        but only have $700 to invest now. 
        What annual interest rate would you need 
        to get this return on your investment?
        Assume the account compounds your interest monthly.

        Suppose you invest $700 in a high-yield savings account 
        that earns 3% annual interest and compounds your interest monthly. 
        In how many years will your investment be worth $1000?

        Suppose you have $123,456, and you choose to open 
        a <em>money-market account</em> with your local credit union
        that guarantees 2.529% APY (Annual Percent Yield),
        where the account interest is compounded monthly.
        <ol>
            <li class="skip-three">
                In order to write down an accurate formula for 
                the account balance at any given time, 
                we need the APR (Annual Percent Rate), not the APY.
                Recall that the APY is the literal percent 
                that your balance will increase by in a year,
                whereas the APR is the raw interest rate 
                prior to consideration of the compounding effect.
                Let \(r\) be the account’s APR
                and let \(R\) be the account’s APY.
                Find the account’s APR 
                by solving for \(r\) in the following equation.
                Round the APR to the nearest tenth-of-a-percent.
                \[P\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12} = P(1+R)\]
            </li>
            <li class="skip-page">
                Using the APR, write down a formula \(S(t)\)
                for the balance of the account after \(t\) years.
            </li>
            <li class="skip-three-half">
                What will the balance of your account be after five years?
                How much total interest did your money earn 
                in those five years?
            </li>
            <li class="skip-page">
                What will the balance of your account be after one month,
                after you receive a single interest payment?
                What is the amount of this interest payment?
                (Typically the units of \(t\) are <em>years</em>.
                Be careful considering what \(t\) must be in this case.)
            </li>
            <li class="skip-three-half">
                How long before the balance of your account 
                will reach $150,000?
            </li>
            <li class="skip-page">
                Suppose instead of compounding your interest monthly,
                the credit union compounded your interest <em>continually</em>.
                How much <em>more</em> interest would you be earning each year?

<h2>Puzzle</h2>
<p>
    <h4 class="screen"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_dollar_riddle">Missing Dollar Riddle</a></h4>
    Three guests check into a hotel room. 
    The manager says the bill is $30, so each guest pays $10. 
    Later the manager realizes the bill should only have been $25. 
    To rectify this, he gives the bellhop $5 
    as five one-dollar bills to return to the guests.
</p>
<p>
    On the way to the guests’ room to refund the money, 
    the bellhop realizes that he cannot equally divide 
    the five one-dollar bills among the three guests. 
    Since the guests are not aware of the total of the revised bill, 
    the bellhop decides to just give each guest $1 back 
    and keep $2 as a tip for himself, and proceeds to do so.
</p>
<p>
    Since each guest got $1 back, each guest only paid $9, 
    bringing the total paid to $27. 
    The bellhop kept $2, which when added to the $27, comes to $29. 
    So if the guests originally handed over $30, 
    what happened to the remaining $1?
