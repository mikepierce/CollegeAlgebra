                Just based on the shape of the data in the scatter plot,
                it could also be a reasonable choice
                to use a power function to model this data.
                However, financial figures are often modelled 
                exponentially due to the notion that 
                <em>financial growth is proportional to current wealth</em>
                (a more balanced take on the saying “the rich get richer”),
                and this is a defining feature of exponential functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                Comparing power functions with exponential functions,
                as their input increases (gets bigger and bigger),
                which function “grows faster”?
                You may want to perform regression to calculate 
                a power function of the form \(at^b.\)

                    In the years since 2018,
                    life expectancy in the US has started to decline.
                    <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/08/31/1120192583/">
                        Someone born in the US in 2019, 2020, and 2021
                        has a life expectancy of 79 years, 77 years, and 76.1 years respectively
                    </a>.
                    Add this new data to the data set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both logarithmic and power functions are increasing functions.
                    Since life expectancy is decreasing in recent years though,
                    these functions may no longer provide the most accurate models.
                    What’s a type of function that more accurately models
                    data that initially increases, but then begins to decrease?
                    Using technology, perform regression to
                    find such function \(h(t)\)
                    that models the data,
                    again with \(t\) equal to \(0\) in 1900.

            </li>
            <li class="skip-one">
                What does this new model predict
                the life expectancy of a baby born today to be?
                How does this compare to the figure predicted
                by either your logarithmic or power model?

                What sort of function do you think should be used

                of accurately predicting future life expectancy?
                Another option you may want to consider is a 
                <em>logistic</em> (different than <em>logarithmic</em>) model;
                look up a picture of the graph of a logistic function.
