        A <em>tribble</em> is an alien creature that,
        given an adequate food supply,
        is known to produce a litter of ten offspring every twelve hours.
        Due to this fact, if you start with 
        a population of \(N_0\) tribbles,
        after \(t\) twelve-hour intervals the size of the population 
        will be modelled by the function \(N(t) = N_0 (11)^t.\)
        <ol>
            <li class="skip-one-half">
                If you have an initial population of only two tribbles,

                as an exponential function with base \(\mathrm{e},\)
                the natural base. I.e., you’ll need to find \(k\) 
                such that \(N_0 (11)^t = N_0\mathrm{e}^{kt}.\)

        TK According to a simple version of <em>Newton’s law of cooling</em>,
        if an object with initial temperature \(T_0\) 
        is placed in an environment with ambient temperature \(T_s,\)
        then its temperature over time \(T(t)\) 
        can be modelled by the equation 
        \[T(t)= T_s+(T_0-T_s)\mathrm{e}^{-kt}\,,\]
        where \(k\) is some constant depending on 
        the ability of the object to absorb/diffuse heat.

        At a standard roulette table in the US, 
        if you bet on a single number, 
        and the wheel lands on that number, 
        you win 35 times your original bet.
        </p>
        <p>
        Suppose you start with $100,
        and bet it on a single number, and win!
        You decide to let-it-ride, 
        betting all your winnings on a single number again, 
        and you win again!
        If you continue doing this,
        how many times will you have to win 
        before you become the richest person on earth?
        (Look up how much money this entails.)

    There are five houses of different colors 
    next to each other on the same road.

    Each woman has her favorite drink, her favorite brand of cigarettes, 
    and keeps a particular kind of pet.
</p>
<p>
    The Englishwoman lives in the red house.
    <br>The Swede keeps dogs.
    <br>The Dane drinks tea.
    <br>The green house is just to the left of the white one.
    <br>The owner of the green house drinks coffee.
    <br>The Pall Mall smoker keeps birds.
    <br>The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhills.
    <br>The woman in the center house drinks milk.
    <br>The Norwegian lives in the first house.
    <br>The Blend smoker has a neighbor who keeps cats.
    <br>The woman who smokes Blue Masters drinks bier.
    <br>The woman who keeps horses lives next to the Dunhill smoker.
    <br>The German smokes Prince.
    <br>The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
