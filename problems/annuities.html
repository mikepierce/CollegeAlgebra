    Recall the formulas for annuities,
    \[
    S = P\left(\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}-1}{\frac{r}{12}}\right)
    \qquad\text{and}\qquad
    S = P\left(\frac{1-\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{-12t}}{\frac{r}{12}}\right)\,,
    \]
    where \(P\) is the payment/withdrawal amount per month,
    \(r\) is the annual interest rate,
    and \(S\) is the annuity account’s balance after \(t\) years.
    The left formula is for when the balance is headed away from zero
    (the payments and interest push the balance in the same direction),
    and the right formula is for when the balance is headed towards zero
    (the payments and interest push the balance in opposite directions).
    The formulas assume interest is calculated and added monthly.

        Suppose Anita wants to save up for 
        a down payment on a home.
        She opens an annuity account with her bank
        that offers 3% annual interest compounded monthly,
        and she plans to deposit $800 per month.
        <ol>
            <li>
                How much will she have saved 
                for a down payment after five years?

            <li>
                How much would she had saved 
                if she instead stashed $800 into a coffee can 
                burried in her backyard each month?

        Over the course of his life, 
        Billiam has saved up $1.2 million 
        in a retirement account that yields 2.5% annual interest.
        He’s 67 now, and ready to retire.
        <ol>
            <li>
                If Billiam anticipates living to be 100-years-old
                and wants his saving to last that long,
                how much can he afford to withdraw each month?
            </li>
            <li>
                Billiam decides that’s not enough money per month
                to support his extravagant lifestyle,
                so he withdraws $7000 per month in his retirement instead.
                How old will Billiam be when he runs out of money?
                <!-- 17.7 years later -->
            </li>
            <li class="hard">
                Billiam finds this unacceptable! 
                He is convinced he’ll live to be 100-years-old,
                and he will settle for no less than $7000 per month in his retirement.
                The only option then is to defer his retirement and keep working.
                If Billiam can contribute $2,200 per month 
                into his retirement account while he’s working,
                when can he finally retire?

        Suppose you are contributing $600 a month 
        into a savings annuity account, intended to be your retirement account,
        that pays an annual interest rate of 3.7% compounded monthly. 
        <ol>
            <li class="skip-four">
                Using just a desk calculator (TI or phone), 
                manually calculate the balance of your annuity account 
                40 years in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now using the <code>Excel</code> spreadsheet 
                that has been pre-programmed with the annuity formulas
                and the amortization schedule,
                enter the values of $600 for \(P\) and 3.7% for \(r\)
                to verify your answer to the last question,
                and then answer the following questions:
                <ol>
                    <li class="skip-half">
                        What will the balance of the retirement annuity be
                        after fifty years?
                    </li>
                    <li class="skip-page">
                        One of the things the chart illustrates
                        is the total amount of money you’ve invested after so many years.
                        What kind of function (model) describes this amount over time?
                    </li>
                    <li class="skip-one">
                        The other thing the chart illustrates
                        is the total balance of the retirement annuity.
                        What kind of function (model) describes this amount over time?
                    </li>
                    <li class="skip-one">
                        Play around in the spreadsheet 
                        with different initial values of \(P\)
                        to figure out how much you would need to deposit each month
                        so that the balance of the account would be 
                        $2 million in forty years.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Suppose you bought a house.
        After making a down-payment,
        you apply for a mortgage with an annual 5.99% interest rate
        on the remaining balance of $251,200.
        Recall that the formula relating these values 
        to your monthly mortgage payments \(P\) is
        \[S = P\left(\frac{1-\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{-12t}}{\frac{r}{12}}\right)\,.\]
        <ol>
            <li class="skip-one-half">
                <em>Before plugging in numbers</em>,
                solve this equation for \(P\) 
                so you have a formula for your monthly mortgage payments.
                (Think before you start—this can be done in one step.)
            </li>
            <li class="skip-page">
                Using this formula, 
                calculate what your monthly payments would be
                if you got a 15-year mortgage versus a 30-year mortgage.
            </li>
            <li class="skip-two">
                Because the balance of the mortgage 
                accrues interest while you are paying it off,
                the total amount you pay will be more 
                than the initial mortgage amount;
                you are paying for the interest too.
                Using your answers to the previous question,
                calculate how much money you’d be paying <em>total</em>
                in the case of a 15-year mortgage and the case of a 30-year mortgage.
                (Hint: don’t overthink these calculations.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Now using the <strong>Mortgage</strong> worksheet
                of the <code>Excel</code> spreadsheet,
                check your calculations from the previous questions.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the <strong>Mortgage</strong> worksheet
        to perform the calculations you need to answer these questions
        about a 30-year mortgage on a $360,000 home
        at a 5.5% annual interest rate,
        <ol>
            <li class="skip-one">
                What will the monthly mortgage payments be?
            </li>
            <li class="skip-page">
                Multiply the monthly mortgage payment by \(12\)
                to figure out the annual housing cost. 
                Now, the classical advice is that 
                ”no more than 28% of a person’s income
                should go towards housing.”
                Adhering to this rule, 
                what would a person’s annual income (after taxes)
                need to be to afford this mortgage?
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Your Own Financials</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
    <p>
        While you’ve got the <strong>Mortgage</strong> worksheet open,
        you might as well play with numbers to get a sense
        of what your personal situation will be 
        when/if you decide to buy a home.
        There’s two critical questions to answer:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Where do you plan on buying a home (living)?  </li>
        <li> What sort of income do you anticipate having?  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Look up average home prices in the area you’re planning on living,
        but also look up lower-end home prices 
        (if there are enough luxury homes in the area, 
        they’ll skew the average, making it misleading).
        Then try to estimate your future annual income:
        if you have a career/title in mind, 
        look up <em>starting salaries/earnings</em> for that career.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some quick facts:
        First, the vast majority of mortgages have a 30-year term,
        so use \(N=30\) unless you have a good reason otherwise.
        Next, the typical interest rate of a mortgage is set by the 
        <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/federal-funds-rate/">Federal Funds Rate</a>.
        Look up what this currently is for your mortgage rate \(r\), 
        and look up any news on speculation 
        for how it will change in the future.
        Last, the classic advice is that 
        “28% of your gross income should go towards housing.”
        This advice is suspect given recent trends
        in the housing market and labor market,
        but should still be considered when deciding 
        what monthly mortgage payment \(P\) you can afford
        given your projected income.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
        Notice that there’s <strong>Student Loans</strong> worksheet 
        in this Excel file too.
        If you have them, you could take this time 
        to work out the details of your own student loans
        <span class="print">(You don’t have to write anything on this page!)</span>
        What is the interest rate on your loans?
        How much are you taking out in loans each year/semester?
        There’s one initial important thing to know:
        are your loans subsidized or unsubsidized?
        <ul>
            <li>
                Subsidized students loans don’t accrue interest
                while you are still attending school 
                and during some “grace period” after graduation
                until (ideally) you find employment,
                because the government is paying the interest.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unsubsidized loans simply accrue interest.
            </li>
        </ul>
        While you are not making payments, 
        if your loans are accruing interest
        the balance of your student debt
        can be calculated using the formula for compound interest.
        As soon as you begin making payments,
        interest is still accruing,
        so the balance will be described the annuity formula
        we’ve been discussing.
