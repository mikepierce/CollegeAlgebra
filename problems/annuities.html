    Recall the formulas for annuities,
    \[
    S = P\left(\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}-1}{\frac{r}{12}}\right)
    \qquad\text{and}\qquad
    S = P\left(\frac{1-\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{-12t}}{\frac{r}{12}}\right)\,,
    \]
    where \(P\) is the payment/withdrawal amount per month,
    \(r\) is the annual interest rate,
    and \(S\) is the annuity account’s balance after \(t\) years.
    The left formula is for when the balance is headed away from zero
    (the payments and interest push the balance in the same direction),
    and the right formula is for when the balance is headed towards zero
    (the payments and interest push the balance in opposite directions).
    The formulas assume interest is calculated and added monthly.

        Suppose Anita wants to save up for 
        a down payment on a home.
        She opens an annuity account with her bank

                How much would she had saved

        Over the course of his life, 
        Billiam has saved up $1.2 million in a retirement account 
        that yields 2.5% annual interest compounded monthly.
        He’s 67 now, and ready to retire.

                If Billiam anticipates living to be 100-years-old

                Billiam decides that’s not enough money per month

                so he proposes to withdraw $7000 per month in his retirement instead.

        Suppose you are contributing $600 a month 
        into a savings annuity account, intended to be your retirement account,
        that pays an annual interest rate of 3.7% compounded monthly. 
        Recall that the formula relating these values 
        to the current account balance \(S\) after \(t\) years is

                        to figure out how much you would need to deposit each month
                        so that the balance of the account would be

        Suppose you bought a house.
        After making a down-payment,
        you apply for a mortgage with an annual 5.99% interest rate
        on the remaining balance of $251,200.
        Recall that the formula relating these values 
        to your monthly mortgage payments \(P\) is
        \[S = P\Biggl(\frac{1-\bigl(1+\frac{r}{12}\bigr)^{-12t}}{\frac{r}{12}}\Biggr)\,.\]

            <li class="skip-one-half">
                <em>Before plugging in numbers</em>,
                solve this equation for \(P\) 
                so you have a formula for your monthly mortgage payments.
                (Think before you start—this can be done in one step.)

                Manually calculate what your monthly payments would be

            </li>
            <li class="skip-page">
                Because the balance of the mortgage 
                accrues interest while you are paying it off,
                the total amount you pay will be more 
                than the initial mortgage amount
                since you are paying for the interest too.
                Using your answers to the previous question,
                calculate how much money you’d be paying <em>total</em>
                in the case of a 15-year mortgage and the case of a 30-year mortgage.
                (Hint: don’t overthink these calculations.)

                Unable to afford a 15-year mortgage,
                you decide to go with the 30-year option.
                You can however afford to pay more towards this mortgage
                than the minimum required monthly payments that you calculated.
                Supposing you pay $300 per month towards your mortgage
                in addition to the regular monthly payment,
                how long will it be before you’ve paid off the entire mortgage?

        Do some research to figure out
        (1) the median price of a house in the town/city 
        where you plan on working after college,
        and (2) the current federal interest rate
        from which mortgage rates are determined.
        Suppose you take out a mortgage on such a house
        for the typical 30-year term.
        <ol>
            <li class="skip-three">
                What will your monthly mortgage payments be?
            </li>
            <li class="skip-two">
                Multiply that monthly mortgage payment by 12
                to figure out your annual housing cost. 
                Now, the classical advice is that 
                ”no more than 28% of a person’s take-home pay
                (income after taxes) should go towards housing.”
                Adhering to this rule, 
                what would your annual take-home pay need to be
                to afford this mortgage?
                What annual income (pre-taxes) would you need?

        Recall Billiam’s situation from earlier.
        Suppose Billiam is convinced he will live to 100-years-old 
        <em>and</em> will settle for no less than $7000 per month during his retirement.
        The only option then is to defer his retirement and keep working.
        If Billiam can contribute $2,200 per month 
        into his retirement account while he’s still working,
        when can he finally retire?
