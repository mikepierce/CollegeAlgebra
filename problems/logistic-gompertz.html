        of Ebola in Western Africa.

        total (cumulative) number of cases
        in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, 
        by month for the first year and a half of the epidemic,

        The total number of cases could initially be 
        accurately modelled by an exponential function.
        But as the spread of the disease began to slow, 
        and the data began to take on a <em>sigmoid</em> shape,
        a different model was needed.
        <ol>
            <li class="skip-page">
                Sketch a scatter plot of the data on the axes below.
                (plan the scaling of your axes before you begin!)
                <figure> <img width="864" src="img/axes-firstquad/out.png"> </figure>
                Then using technology capable of regression,
                ideally Desmos, find an equation \(P(t)\) 
                for the <em>logistic</em> function
                that best models this data,
                and carefully sketch it on the plot.
            </li>
            <li class="skip-two">
                One of the defining features of a logistic function
                is that is has a strict upper-limit,
                usually called the <em>carrying capacity</em>.
                What is the upper-limit that your specific logistic model 
                for this data indicates, and what is does this number mean 
                in the context of the Ebola epidemic?

            <li class="skip-page">
                <p>
                The <em>inflection point</em> of a logistic curve
                is the point that is vertically half-way 
                between zero and the upper-limit,
                where the curve “turns” and begins to level-out.
                I.e. it’s the point where the logistic function
                stops increasing exponentially.
                In relation to this situation,
                the inflection point corresponds to the 
                time when the number of <em>new</em> Ebola cases each month
                starts to decrease rather than increase.

                <p>
                During which month after March 2014 
                is the inflection point of our logistic model?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="skip-one">
                There’s an obvious inconsistency between the data
                and the upper-limit this logistic model suggests; 
                what is it?
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/history/2014-2016-outbreak/cumulative-cases-graphs.html">According to the CDC</a>,
                the final tally of Ebola cases in west Africa
                once the pandemic was declared over, was \(28616.\)
                With this fact in mind we can find a better model.
                Plot the following Gompertz function 
                along with your logistic model and the data 
                to visually verify it’s a reasonable model
                for the total number of Ebola cases.

        If you were to plot this data,
        you’d notice that the data trends along
        a very slight sigmoid-shaped curve,
