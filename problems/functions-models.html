<h2>Puzzle</h2>
<p>
    Two brothers ran a hundred-meter race,
    and the older brother won by three meters. 
    In other words, when the older brother reached the finish line, 
    the younger brother had run ninety-seven meters.
    They decided to race again, this time with the older brother 
    starting three meters behind the starting line. 
    Assuming that both boys ran the second race at the same speed as before, 
    was the second race a tie? Or did one of them win?
