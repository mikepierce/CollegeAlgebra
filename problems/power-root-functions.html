        For an investment of \(P\) dollars 
        growing at an annual interest rate of \(r\) 
        that is compounded monthly,
        this following formula relates the value \(S\) 
        of the investment <em>after \(t\) years</em>.
        \[ S = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} \]

        There is a unique parabola that passes through the points 
        \((0,5),\) \((4,13),\) and \((—2,25)\)

        Write the formula for the quadratic function

        In the production of a plumbus, 
        there are two main raw materials that are required: 
        absidian and borron. 
        It turns out that the number of units of absidian required 
        to produce the plumbus varies directly with the cube 
        of the amount of borron (in pounds) that is required. 
        <ol>
            <li class="skip-one-half">
                Define two variables, 
                one to represent the amount of absidian 
                and another to represent the amount of borron. 
                <!--
                Then write down an expression for 
                the <q>cube of the amount of borron</q> in
                terms of the variable you picked for borron.
                -->
                Then, recalling what it means 
                for two quantities to <em>vary directly</em>, 
                write down the equation our situation suggests.
            </li>
            <li class="skip-three">
                Suppose \(500\) units of absidian and 5lbs of borron 
                are required to produce 100 plumbuses. 
                Use this information to find out 
                what the direct variation coefficient 
                (usually denoted as the variable \(k\)) must be.
            </li>
            <li class="skip-page">
                Now that we know \(k\), we know everything.
                If we have 10lbs of borron 
                lying around the plumbus factory, 
                how many units of absidian do we need to go forage 
                to turn it <em>all</em> into plumbuses?
