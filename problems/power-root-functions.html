        For an investment of \(P\) dollars 
        growing at an annual interest rate of \(r\) 
        that is compounded monthly,
        this following formula relates the value \(S\) 
        of the investment <em>after \(t\) years</em>.
        \[ S = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} \]

        The <em>wind chill index</em>
        is a measurement of how cold it feels outside 
        due to the effects of the wind whipping away 
        surface heat from your body.
        During cold weather, 
        this is the “feels like” temperature
        that meteorologist list in weather reports.
        According to the 
        <a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/cold-wind-chill-chart">National Weather Service</a>,
        the following formula relates the wind chill index \(W\)
        with the wind velocity \(v\) (mph) 
        and ambient air temperature \(t\) (°F).
        \[ W = 35.74 + 0.6215t - (35.75 - 0.4275t)v^{0.16} \]
        <ol>
            <li class="skip-one">
                For a fixed temperature \(t\)
                you can write the windchill 
                as a function of the wind velocity, \(W(v)\).
                Write down a formula for \(W(v)\)
                for an ambient air temperature of 45°F.
            </li>
            <li class="skip-one">
                Using your formula for \(W(v),\)
                calculate how cold it feels like
                due to windchill on a 45°F day
                when the wind is gusting up to 40mph.
            </li>
            <li class="skip-two">
                On a 45°F day,
                how fast does the wind need to be blowing
                to make it feels like it’s 32°F?
            </li>
            <li class="skip-page">
                Look up the current temperature 
                and max wind speed for today
                to calculate how cold it “feels like” 
                outside due to wind chill.

        In the production of a plumbus, 
        there are two main raw materials that are required: 
        absidian and borron. 
        It turns out that the number of units of absidian required 
        to produce the plumbus varies directly with the cube 
        of the amount of borron (in pounds) that is required. 
        <ol>
            <li class="skip-one-half">
                Define two variables, 
                one to represent the amount of absidian 
                and another to represent the amount of borron. 
                <!--
                Then write down an expression for 
                the <q>cube of the amount of borron</q> in
                terms of the variable you picked for borron.
                -->
                Then, recalling what it means 
                for two quantities to <em>vary directly</em>, 
                write down the equation our situation suggests.
            </li>
            <li class="skip-three">
                Suppose \(500\) units of absidian and 5lbs of borron 
                are required to produce 100 plumbuses. 
                Use this information to find out 
                what the direct variation coefficient 
                (usually denoted as the variable \(k\)) must be.
            </li>
            <li class="skip-page">
                Now that we know \(k\), we know everything.
                If we have 10lbs of borron 
                lying around the plumbus factory, 
                how many units of absidian do we need to go forage 
                to turn it <em>all</em> into plumbuses?
            </li>
        </ol>
