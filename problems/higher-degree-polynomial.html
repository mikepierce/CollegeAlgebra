        Recall that a polynomial of degree \(n\)
        may have <em>at most</em> \(n\) roots (\(x\)-intercepts).
        Can you come up with an example 
        of a cubic (degree three) polynomial with three roots?
        What about a cubic polynomial with just one root?
        What about with two roots? 
        What about with no roots at all?

<h3>Puzzle</h3>
<p>
    Three friends Anita, Becca, and Charleston 
    are challenged to a game by the Game Maestra.
    The Game Maestra paints two colored dots 
    on each of their foreheads
    and tells them that each dot is either blue or yellow,
    but neither color is used more than four times.
    She then places the three friends in a circle 
    so that each of them can see the dots on their friends’ foreheads, 
    but not the dots on their own.
    The game proceeds like this:
    The Maestra will ask the friends in turn, 
    first Anita, then Becca, then Charleston, then Anita again, 
    then Becca again, and so on, 
    if they know the colors of the dots on their foreheads.
    When someone responds “no,” the Maestra asks the next person.
    If someone responds “yes” and is right, the friends win!
    However if someone responds “yes” and is wrong, 
    all three friends will be banished to the shadow realm for eternity.
</p>
<p>
    The friends were given no time to strategize, 
    but they begin playing. 
    Their responses in turn are
    “no,”
    “no,”
    “no,”
    “no,”
    “yes,”
    and the three friends win! 
    Whare are the colors of the dots on Becca’s forehead?
