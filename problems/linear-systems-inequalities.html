        Janet has $123,000 cash that she’d like to invest.
        She’s researched two different investments accounts:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A money-market fund offered by her local credit union
                that guarantees a 6.9% annual return.
            </li>
            <li>
                A high risk mutual fund that is <em>projected</em>
                to net 7.7% annual return.
            </li>
        </ul>
        She wants to balance her investment between these two funds
        to get an expected return of 7.2%. 
        How should should split up her principal investment
        between these two funds?
        <details class="solution">
            <summary>Answer</summary>
            Letting \(A\) be the amount she invests in the money-market fund
            and \(B\) be the amount she invests in the mutual fund,
            we can write two equations:
            one about the total principal (how much money she has to invest),
            and another equation about the interest she expects.
            Then the answer we seek is the solution to the system
            \[
            \begin{cases}
            A &+&B &=& 123000
            \\0.069A &+&0.077B &=& 8865
            \end{cases} \,.
            \]
            Solving this system, we calculate that 
            she should put $76,875 in the money-market fund
            and $46,125 in the mutual fund.

        <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sugar+in+mountain+dew">Mountain Dew</a>™ contains 3.875g sugar per fluid ounce,
        whereas <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sugar+in+orange+juice">orange juice</a> contains about 2.625g sugar per fluid ounce.
        How many fluid ounces of each would you need to mix 
        to get a gallon (128 fl.oz.) of a delicious drink 
        that has 3g sugar per fluid ounce?
        <details class="solution">
            <summary>Answer</summary>
            Letting \(D\) be the number of ounces of Mountain Dew
            and \(J\) be the number of ounces of orange juice,
            we’ll write one equation relating the total amount of fluid we want,
            and another equation relating the total amount of sugar we want.
            Then the answer we seek is the solution to the system
            \[
            \begin{cases}
            D &+& J &=& 128
            \\ 3.875D &+& 2.625J &=& 384
            \end{cases}\,.
            \]
            Solving this system, we calculate that 
            we’ll need \(D = 38.4\) fluid ounces of Mountain Dew
            and \(J = 89.6\) fluid ounces of orange juice.

        My bro Mikey is on a very special diet of bananas and watermelons.
        He also holds himself to a very strict dietary requirement
        of getting 37.5g of fiber and 214.4g of sugar per day.
        <aside>
            Note: this is a healthy amount of fiber,
            but concerning his sugar intake, 
            I suspect Mikey has a problem.
        </aside>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/bananas#nutrition">average-sized banana</a>
                contains about 12.2g of sugar and 2.6g of fiber.
            </li>
            <li>
                One <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/watermelon#nutrition">cup of watermelon</a>
                contains about 9.3g of sugar and 0.6g of fiber.
            </li>
        </ul>
        How many bananas and cups of watermelons 
        must Mikey eat per day to meet his dietary requirement?
        <details class="solution">
            <summary>Answer</summary>
            Let \(B\) be the number of bananas
            and let \(W\) be the number of cups of watermelon
            that Mikey plans to eat.
            Writing one equation relating to Mikey’s fiber intake
            and another relating to his sugar intake,
            the answer we seek is the solution to the system
            \[
            \begin{cases}
            2.6B &+&0.6W &=& 37.5
            \\ 12.2B &+&9.3W &=& 214.4
            \end{cases} \,.
            \]
            Solving this system, we calculate that 
            he needs to eat \(B=13\) bananas
            and \(W=6\) cups of watermelon per day.

        The drugs Aryzindrid and Boquaflox are each designed to treat 
        the rare medical condition oxyfloxridomosis.
        Aryzindrid is a newer drug, 
        while Boquaflox has been prescribed since the mid 90s.
        <ul>
            <li>
                At the beginning of last year, 
                Aryzindrid only had a 1.5% share of the oxyfloxridomosis treatment market.
                However the manufacturers of Aryzindrid 
                funded a huge marketing campaign and by the end of last year
                Aryzindrid’s market share was 62.3%!
            </li>
            <li>
                Boquaflox had 81.1% market share at the beginning of last year,
                but after the marketing push by the makers of Aryzindrid, 
                it dropped to a 23.7% share by the end of the year.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            At what average rate <em>per week</em> 
            did Aryzindrid gain market share last year?
            At what average rate <em>per week</em> 
            did Boquaflox lose market share last year?
            (Remember there are fifty-two weeks in a year.)
        </p>
        <details class="solution">
            <summary>Answer</summary>
            \[
            \frac{62.3\% - 1.5\%}{52\text{ weeks}} \approx 1.17\%\text{ per week}
            \qquad
            \frac{23.7\% - 81.1\%}{52\text{ weeks}} \approx -1.1\%\text{ per week}
            \]

            Assuming the market share of each drug 
            changed linearly throughout the year —
            i.e. each function of their market shares over time 
            can be approximated as a linear equation —
            what week during the year did the two drugs
            have the same market share?
        </p>
        <details class="solution">
            <summary>Answer</summary>
            Writing down the linear equations for 
            each their market shares,
            the answer we seek is the \(t\)-coordinate
            of the solution to this system of equations:
            \[
            \begin{cases}
            y &= 1.17t + 1.5
            \\ y &= -1.1t + 81.1
            \end{cases}
            \]
            (Remember the units on \(y\) are \(\%\).)
            Solving this system, we calculate that 
            \(t \approx 35\), so their market shares were the same
            at the thirty-fifth week.
            At this week, \(y \approx 42.53\%\),
            so this was their market share at this time.
