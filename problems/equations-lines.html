                If not, try to adjust the parameters of the model slightly,
                to make it better fit the data.

                Do you think it’s a reasonable idea to use \(p\)
                as a model for gas prices in the future?
                I.e. do you think \(p\) can accurately predict 
                gas prices in the year 2025? or 2030?
