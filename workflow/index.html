<p>
    This class meets four days a week. 
    Typically every-other meeting will be lecture-based.
    During these lecture days you should focus on 
    (1) doing exercises to develop mechanical <em>skills</em>
    and (2) reading to understand core <em>concepts</em>.
    At the other meetings each week you will
    solve problems in groups based on the week’s lessons.
    It’s crucial that you exercise and read during these first three days
    so that by these class meetings
    you are prepared to focus solving problems
    and won’t be bogged down by the basics.
</p>
<p>
    To avoid exhausting yourself with mathematics,
    relegate the time you spend thinking about this class to the workweek,
    and reserve a sincere break for yourself during the weekend.
</p>

<h3>Before the Week’s Class Meetings …</h3>
<p>
    Briskly read about the topics for the week:
    you’ll get more out of the lecture 
    if you’re already familiar with the topics,
    and if you’ve already encountered any perplexing ideas
    and begun to form questions.
    If you have the time, consider starting on some exercises too.
</p>

<h3>After Each Lecture, Before the Next Class …</h3>
<p>
    Reflect on what the <em>skills</em> and <em>concepts</em> 
    core to the day’s lesson were, and get started doing exercises,
    either online or in the textbook, to practice those skills,
    and doing further reading to internalize those concepts.
    If any homework exercise has you stumped,
    discuss it with your peer group from the class,
    or visit the campus <a href="https://www.coloradomesa.edu/tutoring/">Tutorial Learning Center (TLC)</a>,
    or visit the <a href="https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~mapierce2/">instructor’s office hours</a>.
</p>

<h3>After each Problem-Solving Session …</h3>
<p>
    Read over all the problems handed out in class, and ensure 
    (1) that you understand what each problem is asking of you,
    and (2) that you are confident you know how to solve each problem.
    It’s not crucial that you write up solutions to all the problems,
    but you should <em>be able to</em>.
    Again, if any problem has you stumped,
    discuss it with your peers or the TLC or your instructor.
</p>

<h3>Before Each Midterm Exam …</h3>
<p>
    Read over 
    <!-- the <a href="../summary">course summary</a> and -->
    the <em>Student Learning Outcomes</em> in the syllabus
    to calibrate your focus towards what’s important.
    Then print out any past exam from this course to use as practice.
    Considering setting a 50-minute timer and “taking” each exam.
