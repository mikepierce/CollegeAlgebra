# [College Algebra](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~mapierce2/113/)

This is the schedule/outline 
for my ~16 week general education College Algebra course.
Within each section are links to notes, video lectures, 
technology guides, demonstrations in Desmos,
practice exercises, problems, and past exams.
Chapters enumerated with § refer to
[*College Algebra 6ed*, Harshbarger and Yocco](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/college-algebra-in-context-with-applications-for-the-managerial-life-and-social-sciences/P200000006206).

### How You Might Use this Outline

  - **Harvest it for Resources** – 
If you're teaching a similar course,
there's likely overlap between the curriculum of your course and this one.
Peruse [my instance of this outline](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~mapierce2/113/),
and look for any resources your students would appreciate.

  - **Fork/Clone it as a Template** – 
If you're teaching a sufficiently similar class soon, 
especially if you're also following the same textbook,
forking or cloning this outline as an initial template 
and editing it to fit your schedule/pacing/standards may save time.
