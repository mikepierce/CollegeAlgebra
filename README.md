This is the schedule/outline 
for my ~16week general education college algebra course.
It’s augmented with links to notes, video lectures, 
practice exercises and problems, demonstrations in Desmos,
and some extra-curricular digressions.
The primary narrative follows 
[*College Algebra 6ed*, by Harshbarger and Yocco](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/college-algebra-in-context-with-applications-for-the-managerial-life-and-social-sciences/P200000006206).

### Use this Outline

  - **Promote it to Your Students** – 
  Send your students a link to
  [my instance of this outline](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~mapierce2/113/).
  Easy-peasy. Maybe they'll find something helpful.
  Otherwise dive in yourself to find resources 
  in the outline that your students would appreciate.

  - **Fork/Clone it as a Template** – 
  If you're teaching a sufficiently similar class soon, 
  especially if you're also following the same textbook,
  cloning this outline as an initial template 
  and editing it to fit your schedule/pacing/standards can save time.
