<main>
<p>
    Sometimes the purpose of taking a course 
    becomes obfuscated over its duration;
    it can become hard to appreciate the plot of a story 
    when there’s too much exposition.
    This narrative overview, in its brevity, 
    serves to summarize the plot of this course
    and to clarify our purpose,
    for the sake of keeping both student and instructor 
    focused on what’s important.
</p>

<p>
    The intent of this course is to prepare students 
    for studying with the faculty in their major departments.
    This is <em>not</em> to say it covers every tidbit of math
    a student might encounter in their major classes; that would be impossible.
    Instead the goal is to build a basic level of mathematical “literacy” 
    that a typical university faculty member assumes every student has.
    That is, there is a base level of fluency in logic and reasoning,
    and an awareness of the common canon of mathematical topics and ideas,
    that every college student should have for the sake of 
    effectively communicating and understanding academics.
    This course’s purpose is to develop that literacy.
</p>
<p>
    Structurally, the course is designed
    as a tour through that common canon of topics and concepts,
    but whereas the <em>topics</em> can be studied in sequence,
    the <em>ideas</em> are better included as
    themes that recur throughout the study of specific topics.
    Let’s list those themes here
    before describing the sequence of topics in this course.
</p>
<section>

<section>
<h2 id="themes">Recurring Themes</h2>

<!-- SLO: Solve equations, inequalities, and systems of equations, and interpret solutions in context of applications. -->
<!-- SLO: Use an appropriate method (algebraic, graphical, or computational) to solve problems involving linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and inverse functions. -->
<!-- SLO: Apply appropriate technologies such as calculators and spreadsheets to perform computations and analyze mathematical concepts. -->
<h3 id="algebra">Algebra</h3>
<p>
    The namesake of this course, “algebra”, 
    is a rather overloaded word.
    In our context though it just boils down to 
    <em>symbolically manipulating equations</em>.
    The ability to represent mathematical statements 
    symbolically in terms of numbers and variables, 
    as opposed to having to write it out in language,
    is a powerful tool if you can work with such representations.
    I.e. the question <q>What number(s) when squared then tripled 
    is equal to five more than half itself?</q>
    is much easier to answer once you realize 
    it’s the same as solving \(3x^2 = \frac{1}{2}x+5\) for \(x.\)
    And as a modern extension of this, 
    it’s important to be able to accurately transcribe 
    an algebraic expression for a number into a computer/calculator 
    to approximate its decimal value.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Given an equation defined in terms of 
        algebraic, exponential, and logarithmic operations,
        be able to solve the equation for any variable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able effectively use technology to compute 
        a decimal approximation of a number expressed in terms of
        algebraic, exponential, and logarithmic operations.
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- SLO: Identify and describe behavior and properties of functions. -->
<!-- SLO: Choose the type of function (linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, or logarithmic) that best applies in a given scenario. -->
<!-- SLO: Sketch graphs of linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and inverse functions and interpret graphs in context of applications. -->
<!-- SLO: Use an appropriate method (algebraic, graphical, or computational) to solve problems involving linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and inverse functions. -->
<!-- SLO: Translate between geometric concepts and their algebraic representations. -->
<h3 id="geometry">Analytic Geometry</h3>
<p>
    This idea, a relatively modern extension to the study of algebra,
    is that every equation featuring variables has a geometric visualization.
    Specifically in this course, for a function \(f,\)
    the <dfn>graph</dfn> of \(f\) is the set of all points \((x,y)\)
    in two-dimensional space such that \({y = f(x).}\)
    The phrase <dfn>analytic geometry</dfn> refers to 
    the study of functions via features of their graphs.
    This idea is helpful because it affords us two perspectives,
    an algebraic perspective and a geometric perspective,
    on any situation involving a function.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        For any algebraic, exponential, logarithmic, or rational function,
        given its formula be able to sketch the graph of the function,
        or given its graph be able to deduce a plausible formula for the function.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Understand how the features of the formula for 
        an algebraic, exponential, logarithmic, or rational function
        relate to the geometry of its graph, and vice-versa,
        and be able to view any facts about a function
        from the perspective of both its formula and its graph.
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- SLO: Solve equations, inequalities, and systems of equations, and interpret solutions in context of applications. -->
<!-- SLO: Choose the type of function (linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, or logarithmic) that best applies in a given scenario. -->

<!-- SLO: Translate between geometric concepts and their algebraic representations. -->
<h3 id="modelling">Modelling</h3>
<p>
    One utility of mathematics accessible in this course
    is the use of functions to model phenomenon.
    That is if we’re measuring something over time \(t,\)
    it may be helpful to discover a function \(f\)
    such that \(f(t)\) approximates that measurement at time \(t.\)
    This function \(f\) affords us a better view into the phenomenon
    beyond what we can explicitly measure. 
</p>
<p>
    Given a collection of data \(\big\{(x_i, y_i)\big\},\)
    per type of function (linear, exponential, etc) 
    we can use a computer/calculator to perform <dfn>regression</dfn> 
    to compute the formula for that type of function 
    that “best fits” the data.
    I.e. regression gives us a way to compute a function \(f\) 
    such that \(f(x_i) \approx y_i\) for each data points,
    which then serves as a model for the phenomenon.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to use technology to perform regression to commute the formula 
        of a function that best fits data corresponding to a situation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Understand how the algebraic or geometric properties of a function
        that models a situation should be interpreted in that context.
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- SLO: Communicate mathematical ideas and solutions to problems using correct mathematical notation and terminology. -->
<!-- SLO: Communicate mathematical analysis symbolically, graphically, and in written language that clarifies/justifies/summarizes reasoning. -->
<h3 id="literacy">Mathematical Literacy</h3>
<p>
    It’s also important to develop mathematical literacy 
    in the more literal sense of literacy.
    Mathematical symbols are 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech">parts-of-speech</a>
    and so have a proper place in the English language,
    and the exactness of mathematics demands mastery over vocabulary.
    Effectively communicating is an important skill in general,
    and so being able to incorporate mathematical elements 
    into your writing and speech is a theme of this course.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to communicate mathematical ideas effectively,
        using proper notation when necessary.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    All of these themes listed more plainly as personal goals:
    be able to solve equations,
    know the geometry behind equations,
    know what the results of computations <em>mean</em> in context,
    and be able to effectively talk/write about all of it.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="topics">Mathematical Topics</h2>

<h3 id="functions">Functions &amp; Graphs</h3>
<p>
    We start the course defining the main character 
    of most all of modern mathematics, the function.
    A <dfn>function</dfn>, in general, is a correspondence
    between some set of inputs and some set of outputs, 
    but in this class those sets will always be 
    large subsets of the real numbers.
    Most quantities in our world are modelled by real numbers,    
    and so phenomenon in our world 
    can be usefully modelled by such functions.
    <!--
    For a function \(f,\) given \(\square\) as input
    the output of \(f\) corresponding to that input 
    is denoted \(f(\square).\)
    If \(f\) is defined by a formula, 
    conventionally \(x\) is used in place of \(\square\)
    and \(f(x)\) is notation for the formula of \(f.\)
    -->
    The <dfn>domain</dfn> of a function \(f\) 
    is the largest subset of the real numbers 
    that may serve as inputs to \(f\),
    and the <dfn>range</dfn> of a function
    is the set of all its possible outputs.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Understand what a function <em>is</em>
        and the notation commonly used to denote 
        information about functions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    And naturally here we introduce 
    the <a href=#geometry">graph of a function</a>.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="lines">Linear Functions</h3>
<p>
    After discussing functions in general,
    the first specific example that we analyze in depth
    are linear functions, named so for the shape of their graph.
    A <dfn>linear function</dfn> \(f\) 
    has a formula of the template \(f(x) = mx+b.\)
    The two parameters \(m\) and \(b\) have natural interpretations
    in terms of a linear function’s graph:
    the number \(b\) is where the graph intersects the \(y\)-axis,
    and number \(m\) is the <dfn>slope</dfn> of the graph,
    the amount it changes in the \(y\) direction 
    per change of \(1\) unit in the \(x\) direction.
    Beyond understanding lines in view of the 
    <a href="#themes">themes of the course</a>,
    there is one skill worth mentioning specifically:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Given two points in space, 
        be able to calculate an equation 
        for the unique line that passes through those points.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Then lastly, before concluding our study of linear functions,
    we’ll practice analyzing multiple lines simultaneously
    in both the context of their algebra and geometry.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Given two lines in space,
        be able to calculate the point at which they intersects
        or determine that they are parallel.
    </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="quadratics">Quadratic Functions</h3>
<p>
    After lines we’ll study the next-simplest sort 
    of algebraic function, quadratic polynomials.
    A <dfn>quadratic polynomial</dfn> function of \(x\)
    has a formula \(f(x)\)that <em>may</em> be written 
    in any one of the following forms,
    \[ ax^2+bx+c \qquad a(x-h)^2+k \qquad a(x-r_1)(x-r_2) \]
    referred to as <em>standard form</em>, <em>vertex form</em>,
    and <em>factored form</em> respectively.
    The numbers \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) in the factored form,
    if they exist, are called the <dfn>roots</dfn> of \(f\)
    and satisfy \(f(r_1)=0\) and \(f(r_2)=0.\)
    Because \(f\) may not have real roots, 
    it may not have a factored form.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Given the formula for a quadratic function,
        be able to re-write it any of these forms.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The graph of a quadratic function is called a <dfn>parabola</dfn>,
    and each of these forms encodes different information
    about the geometry to the corresponding parabola:
    the vertex of the parabola is located at \((h,k),\)
    the \(x\)-intercepts of the parabola (if they exist)
    are located at \((r_1,0)\) and \((r_2,0),\)
    the \(y\)-intercept of the parabola is located at \((0,c),\)
    and the values of \(a\) and \(b\) correspond to
    the rate at which the outputs are changing with respect to the inputs.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="misc">Miscellaneous Topics on Algebraic Functions</h3>
<p>
    After studying linear and quadratic functions
    we introduce one more examples of function
    before discussing some miscellaneous topics about functions:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Power Functions. </strong>
    A <dfn>power function</dfn> of \(x\) has a formula 
    of the template \(ax^b\) for any real number \(b.\)
    These functions are referred to as <dfn>root functions</dfn>
    in the case that \(0 \lt b \lt 1\) since,
    as a notational convention, \(x^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{x}.\)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Piecewise-Defined Functions. </strong>
    All of the examples of the functions so far 
    have been defined by a single formula,
    but this isn’t necessarily true of functions,
    A function defined in terms of cases, 
    defined differently on different pieces of its domain,
    is called a <dfn>piecewise-defined</dfn> function.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Transformations of Functions. </strong>
    Focusing heavily for a moment on the 
    <a href="#themes">general theme of analytic geometry</a>,
    we study what basic algebraic augmentations 
    to the formula of a function do to transform the shape of its graph.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Given the graph \(y = f(x),\)
        be able to sketch the graph \(y = af(cx+d)+b.\)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Algebraic Operations on Functions. </strong>
    We return briefly to the study of functions via their formulas,
    and define the operations \(+\) and \(-\) and \(\times\) and \(\div\)
    on functions based on those operations’ definitions on their outputs.
    We do define a single new operation on functions though, 
    their <dfn>composite</dfn>, indicated with the symbol \(\circ,\)
    defined to be the function regarded as the two functions applied in serial,
    resulting from taking the outputs of the first function 
    as the inputs of the second.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Given formulas for functions \(f\) and \(g\)
        be able to write down formulas for the functions
        \(f\pm g,\) \(f\times g,\) \(f \div g,\) and \(f \circ g.\)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Functions and their Inverses. </strong>
    We say a function is <dfn>one-to-one</dfn> 
    if every output of the function corresponds to a unique input.
    We say a function \(f\) is <dfn>invertible</dfn>
    if there exists an function \(f^{-1},\) an inverse to \(f,\)
    such that \(f\big(f^{-1}(x)\big) = x\) and \(f^{-1}\big(f(x)\big) = x.\)
    It turns out a function is one-to-one if and only if it’s invertible.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Given a one-to-one function defined by a formula 
        featuring a single instance of its independent variable,
        be able to write a formula for the inverse of that function.
    </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="exp-log">Exponential &amp; Logarithmic Functions</h3>
<aside>
    Exponential and logarithmic functions are examples
    of what are called transcendental functions,
    which are definitively <em>not</em> algebraic.
    However I’ve yet to meet another professional 
    who is bothered by their inclusion in a College <em>Algebra</em> course.
</aside>
<p>
    Next in the course we transcend algebra to talk about
    <dfn>exponential functions</dfn> of the form \(ab^x\)
    (notably the variable \(x\) is in the exponent)
    and their inverse <dfn>logarithmic functions</dfn>.
    We will spend a lot of time going over 
    the mathematical mechanics of these functions
    before looking into their applications.
</p>
<p>
    Exponential functions model measurements that are 
    “growing at a rate proportional to their current size,”
    which makes them apt for studying 
    population growth, disease spread, and finances.
    We look at this last example in depth,
    developing formulas for calculating compounding interest 
    and for savings- and payout-annuities.
    Given a principle balance of \(P\) dollars 
    invested at an annual interest rate of \(r\) 
    compounded \(n\) times per year,
    the total balance after \(t\) years will be 
    \[ P\bigg(1+\frac{r}{n}\bigg)^{nt}. \]
    If instead of being a one-time principle investment
    \(P\) was instead a regular deposit 
    into an (initially empty) account
    made as often as the account earns interest,
    then the balance \(S\) after \(t\) years would be 
    \[ S = P\left(\frac{\Big(1+\frac{r}{n}\Big)^{nt}-1}{\frac{r}{n}}\right) \,.  \]
    If however the account has an initial balance of \(S\) dollars
    and each \(P\) is working towards paying off that balance, 
    then the value of \(S\) after \(t\) years is
    \[ S = P\left(\frac{1-\Big(1+\frac{r}{n}\Big)^{-nt}}{\frac{r}{n}}\right) \,.  \]
</p>
<p>
    Briefly we introduce two other, more sophisticated functions 
    in the “exponential” family, 
    the <dfn>logistic</dfn> function and <dfn>Gompertz</dfn> function
    with these templates as function of \(x\)
    \[ \frac{C}{1 + a\mathrm{e}^{-bx}} \qquad \qquad C\alpha^{r^x} \]
    respectively. The motivation for their introduction
    is the desire to have bounded variations 
    of the typical exponential functions;
    each of these functions ranges are bounded above by \(C.\)
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="polynomial">Polynomial &amp; Rational Functions</h3>
<p>
    To conclude this course we address some of the patterns we noticed
    studying linear and quadratic functions earlier,
    and generalize them to polynomials of arbitrary degree.
    A <dfn>polynomial</dfn>, in full generality, is any function
    that can be defined in terms of applying
    only the operations \(\pm\) and \(\times\) to its input.
    Such a function’s formula has the template
    \[ a_nx^n + x_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dotsb + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0\,. \]
    Much of the study of polynomials, like in the case of 
    <a href="#quadratics">quadratics</a>,
    comes down to finding their roots.
    We examine specific cases of degree-three (<dfn>cubic</dfn>)
    and degree-four (<dfn>quartic</dfn>) polynomials that we can factor,
    and we see how knowing a single root of a polynomial
    allows us to factor at least a linear term from it.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Given a polynomial \(f\) with root \(r\)
        be able to calculate the quotient \(q\) such that
        \[ f(x) = (x-r)\times q(x)\,.  \]
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This leads to a couple natural questions: 
    Can all the roots be factored out from a polynomial one-at-a-time?
    How many roots does a given polynomial have?
    The answer to the first questions is <q>yes</q>,
    whereas the second is more complicated in general.
    After diving in the nuance of that second question for a bit,
    we introduce <dfn>complex numbers</dfn>, 
    numbers of the form \(a+b\mathfrak{i}\) 
    where \(a\) and \(b\) are real and \(\mathfrak{i}^2 = -1,\)
    and explain that their sole purpose is to provide 
    a simple answer to that second question.
</p>
<p class="theorem" title="Fundamental Theorem of Algebra">
    Any polynomial function with complex coefficients
    factors completely over the complex numbers.
</p>
<p>
    And then we briefly introduce <dfn>rational functions</dfn>,
    which are any function that can be defined in terms of applying
    only the operations \(\pm,\) \(\times,\) and \(\div\) to its input.
    Any rational function can be written as the quotient of two polynomials.
    The roots of this “numerator” polynomial 
    are referred to as the roots of the rational function,
    whereas the roots of the “denominator”
    are called <dfn>poles</dfn> of the rational function
    and correspond to vertical asymptotes in the function’s graph.
