<p>
    Now that we have talked about linear regression, 
    we’ve reached a point of mathematical sophistication
    that we can apply what we’ve learned.
    Do some research and find some data online with a 
    <a title="Types of Statistical Data: Numerical, Categorical, and Ordinal" href="https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/math/statistics/types-of-statistical-data-numerical-categorical-and-ordinal-169735/">numerical independent variable</a>
    (so your horizontal axis can be thought of 
    as <em>ascending</em> from left to right)
    that is relevant to your interests or your major. 
    If you don’t know where to look for such data, 
    this page could provide a good starting point:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://learn.g2.com/open-data-sources">G2: 50 Best Open Data Sources […]</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once you find this data, copy it into Excel, 
    plot the data (select the data, 
    then select “Insert” → “Charts” → “Scatter”), 
    and fit a linear model to the data 
    (select the scatter plot points, then select 
    “Chart Design” → “Add Chart Element” → “Trendline” → “Linear”).
    Excel calls this regression line a <em>trendline</em>.
    For the <dfn title="the 'product' you make for this project and hand into me">deliverable</dfn>,
    next class meeting I’d like you to give me a printed copy 
    of your Excel plot marked up with some details and analysis:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Title your plot and label the axes; 
        it should be clear to me,
        or to anyone looking at your plot really,
        what the plot is illustrating.
    </li>
    <!--
    <li>
        (Optional) 
        If your independent variable <var>x</var> is some “large number”, 
        like annual data where <var>x</var> is the current year,
        it’s a good idea to adjust the data so that the lowest
        <var>x</var>-value is zero.
        We’ve seen this in class anytime the context of a model says something like,
        “let <var>x</var> be the number of years <em>since 1995</em>.”
    </li>
    -->
    <li>
        Label your trendline with its formula in Excel:
        double-click trendline, then select “Display Equation on Chart”.
    </li>
    <li>
        Same something smart:
        write a brief analysis of your data.
        At the very least the formula for the trendline tells you
        if the data is increasing or decreasing overall.
        What does the slope of the formula for you model mean
        in the context of your data?
        This can be done in Excel, or post-print by hand.
    </li>
    <li>
        (Optional)
        Customize the design of your plot in Excel; 
        presentation is important.
    </li>
    <li>
        (Optional)
        Play around with different kinds of models 
        that Excel provides, and see if any of them 
        appear to fit your data better than the linear model.
        We’ll be talking about some of these models later in the course.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    My hope is that by keeping this project simple, 
    with only a few requirements,
    you have time to really <em>dig-in</em> 
    to researching data online that interests you, 
    and time to <em>play</em> in Excel to discover its capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    <!--
    This time though, you have a much larger library of models 
    to fit to your data than just a linear model. 
    Go look at the data you used for this project originally 
    and see if there is a model that works better. 
    You'll likely have some time in class beyond this, 
    so go digging for other data sets relevant to your major 
    to model using the techniques we've learned in this class.
